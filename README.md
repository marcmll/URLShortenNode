URL Shortener Node
==================

This small little project is one I made to practice Node JS as well as the usage of Redis as a database.

I am not yet sure if this project will remain in its current form, or if I will continue working on it, adding possible features to it along the way. Nevertheless, it is here for you and it is open-source, so if you wish to, you can fork it and work on it yourself. 

Usage:
-
The usage of this project requires you to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Redis](https://redis.io/download) installed.
When having installed both, the first step is installing all the necessary node modules, required to run this project properly. To do so, navigate to the project folder using your commandline and type:

```
npm install
```

Now that we have all the modules installed we can go ahead and start Redis in another commandline tab with the following command:

```
src/redis-server
```

Finally, to get the project going, in the first tab you used, type:

```
node app.js
```

You can now view the project by opening your browser and typing in ```localhost:3000```
